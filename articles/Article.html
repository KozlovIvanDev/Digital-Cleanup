                      are sent every year, requiring the use of 33 billion Watts
                      of electricity and causing 20 million tonnes of CO2 per
                      year. Moreover, experts from The Shift Project (PDF)
                      indicate that digital technologies’ share of global CO2
                      emissions increased from 2.5 to 3.7 percent between 2013
                      and 2018.

                      the people who are evil, but because of the people who
                      don’t do anything about it.” – Albert Einstein. The need
                      to address climate change remains as urgent as ever and
                      digital cleaning is the ideal starting point. It is hard

                      of cleanup – everybody should try it.

                      unnecessary forgotten old apps and games that you have
                      downloaded, but not yet even really tried. You won’t start
                      using them later either – for sure! They consume energy
                      even when they are not in use. Sort your photos and delete
                      any duplicates and blurry ones.

                      Write short and clear emails that would get to the point
                      straight away. There is no need to overload email by
                      sending ‘ok’ and ‘thank you’ letters! Think about how to
                      avoid sending emails. Instead of that, use more co-working
                      places.

                      is another disaster. It takes 60% of the world’s internet
                      traffic and generates 300m tonnes of carbon dioxide a
                      year. So the way to decrease the amount of streaming time
                      is to download your favourite content (shows, films,
                      songs), instead of running it online multiple times when
                      you rewatch or relisten.

                      million people from 180 countries participate in
                      coordinated cleanups in the last three years. The first

                      I became a member of the national team of “Let’s do it,
                      Ukraine!” this year, where my goal has been to promote and
                      popularize digital cleaning. Firstly, we developed a
                      special Ukrainian website to emphasize the importance of
                      cleaning digital junk. After that, during World Cleanup
                      Day, hundreds of conscious people joined digital cleanups
                      all over Ukraine. Together we removed 1585.8 gigabytes of
                      unnecessary information just in one day. Undoubtedly,
                      actions like this have a surprisingly powerful influence
                      on people. Such acts create a shift in thinking and help
                      individuals understand the need of responding to
                      environmental disasters.

                      Personally for me, participation in the environmental
                      movement is very important. I realized that only
                      systematic actions will help to make the difference in a
                      long-lasting way.That is how we can save our planet!
